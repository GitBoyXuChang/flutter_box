description: 容器类Widget 容器类Widget和布局类Widget都作用于其子Widget，不同的是：  布局类widget一般都需要接收一个widget数组（children），他们直接或间接继承自（或包含）MultiChildRenderObjectWidget ；而容器类Widget一般只需要接受一个子Widget（child），他们直接或间接继承自（或包含）SingleChildRenderObjectWidget。 布局类Widget是按照一定的排列方式来对其子widget进行排列；而容器类Widget一般只是包装其子Widget，对其添加一些修饰（补白或背景色等）、变换(旋转或剪裁等)、或限制(大小等)。

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# Read more about versioning at semver.org.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #  - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #  - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
